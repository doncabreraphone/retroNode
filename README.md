# RetroNode

RetroNode is a Vue.js-based component that makes it easy to design rpg text/graphic adventures through a visual scripting interface. It aims to streamline the game design process, allowing developers and storytellers to construct intricate narrative paths with ease. Each node within RetroNode symbolizes a distinct room or scene, equipped with drag-and-drop capabilities for intuitive spatial arrangement and granular scene configuration.

## Features

- **Visual Scripting Interface**: Allows for intuitive organization of game scenes and rooms through a user-friendly drag-and-drop system.
- **Detailed Scene Customization**: Each node can be customized with images, visibility toggles, and navigational pathways (North, South, East, West) for immersive game experiences.
- **Interactive Scenario Canvas**: Integrates a canvas for rendering interactive scenarios, supporting custom visualization and scenario editing.
- **Control Panel for Quick Access**: Features a floating control panel with buttons for adding scenarios, exporting data, toggling drawing mode, and managing application state.
- **Export Functionality**: Enables exporting scenario data and generated code snippets for easy integration into game logic.
