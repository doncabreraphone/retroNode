# retroNode

retroNode is a tool built with Vue.js designed to simplify the creation of RPG text and graphic adventures. It features a visual scripting interface, making it straightforward for developers and storytellers to craft complex narrative paths. In retroNode, each node represents a unique room or scene. The platform offers drag-and-drop functionality for easy organization and detailed customization of scenes, enabling users to focus on creativity without getting bogged down in technical details.

## Features

- **Visual Scripting Interface**: Allows for intuitive organization of game scenes and rooms through a user-friendly drag-and-drop system.
- **Detailed Scene Customization**: Each node can be customized with images, visibility toggles, and navigational pathways (North, South, East, West) for immersive game experiences.
- **Interactive Scenario Canvas**: Integrates a canvas for rendering interactive scenarios, supporting custom visualization and scenario editing.
- **Control Panel for Quick Access**: Features a floating control panel with buttons for adding scenarios, exporting data, toggling drawing mode, and managing application state.
- **Export Functionality**: Enables exporting scenario data and generated code snippets for easy integration into game logic.

## Dependencies

retroNode leverages the power of Vue.js for its core functionality, enriched with the following key libraries:

- **Vue.js** (`vue`): A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.
- **Fabric.js** (`fabric`): A powerful library for HTML5 canvas manipulation, enabling interactive drawing and object management.
- **Vuedraggable** (`vuedraggable`): A Vue component that allows drag-and-drop functionality, integral for the user interface of retroNode.

Additionally, **core-js** is used to ensure that the application runs smoothly across all modern browsers by providing necessary polyfills.

## Using Tailwind CSS

retroNode utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling. For convenience and ease of use during development, retroNode includes Tailwind CSS via CDN. This setup is sufficient for development and prototyping purposes. However, if you plan to use retroNode in a production environment, or if you need to customize Tailwind's configuration, you may consider installing Tailwind CSS in your project.

## To-do

As of publication, the Zoom is a bit wonky, since I am having troubles calculating the vanishing point. It is a work in progress.
